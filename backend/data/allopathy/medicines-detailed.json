                "description": "Cancer of the colon and rectum affects the large intestine (colon) or its end portion (rectum) and usually begins as small, noncancerous polyps. Over time, these may become cancerous, leading to symptoms like blood in stool, changes in bowel habits, and weight loss. If not diagnosed early, the cancer can spread to other organs such as the liver or lungs. Avastin 100mg Injection helps by blocking the growth of new blood vessels that feed the tumor, thereby slowing its growth. This improves the effectiveness of other cancer treatments and may extend survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer."
